## Description

_A practice project site for a sweets shop. The site has a list of treats offered by the store, as well as a list of flavors to categorize treats by. Users can register for an account if desired. Without an account, users can view the site and the lists of treats and flavors, however, they will need to register for an account to add, modify, or delete any listings. Both treats and flavors have full functionality for creating new listings, editing existing listings, and deletion. Users can also assign flavors to a treat, from either a treat's listing or a flavor's listing._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _You will need [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0), [MySQL](https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/get/p/25/file/mysql-installer-web-community-8.0.19.0.msi), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) in order to run the program._

_1: Clone the repository to a folder of choice on your machine (by either using the "Code" button on the GitHub page, or in a terminal application using `git clone https://github.com/igl-myrick/PierresTreats.Solution`)._

_2: Using a terminal application such as Git Bash or Windows Command Prompt, navigate to the top level of the program folder, then into the `PierresTreats` folder._

_3: You will need to create an `appsettings.json` file within the `PierresTreats` folder, including the following code:_

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=[YOUR-DB-NAME];uid=[YOUR-USER-HERE];pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE];"
  }
}
```

_Insert your own MySQL username in place of [YOUR-USER-HERE], MySQL password in place of [YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE], and the name of your database in place of [YOUR-DB-NAME]._

_4: Once the `appsettings.json` file has been created, run the command `dotnet ef database update` in your terminal to create the database._

_5: Next, run `dotnet build` in the command line to build the program._

_6: Once the program is built, run `dotnet run` to start the program._

_7: When the program is running, navigate to `https://localhost:5001` to view and use the website._
